 My VBA routines

## Background


This archive contains various VBA snippets of code that I either created or collated over the years. They form part of my own private library which I have decided to publish for anyone to use should they find them helpful.
Feel free to add your own VBA routines and expand this library!

Note: Since this code was written originally for private use only, the code itself may be a little raw, but hopefully mostly self explanatory!
